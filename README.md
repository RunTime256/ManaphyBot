# ManaphyBot
A Javacord bot

Manaphy is a passion project of mine made almost exclusively for the r/Pok√©mon Discord Server. Developed in Java, this is an improvement on my previous iteration of the bot written using the Discord 4J v2 library. However, that library became depreciated and v3 was too complex for my needs. Therefore, I switched over to Javacord and started from scratch.

A primary goal of my design was to make a bot that is easy to develop and easy to refactor in case the library changes. With uniform functionality, fixes can be isolated to just one part of the bot rather than being heavily dependant on other portions.

Overall, I am excited to develop Manaphy and I hope it is enjoyed while it runs on Discord. I hope you check it out!

P.S. Any issues with the bot should be reported to RunTime256#0131 on Discord. Please DM me with a screenshot of what happened when something went wrong.
